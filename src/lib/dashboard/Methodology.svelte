    We are using Scrum because of its flexibility and focus on iterative development. Our project is starting from the ground up and the final desired deliverable is a prototype that can be deployed to a few select universities to pilot the new system. This focus on iteration will allow us to demo our progress to our sponsor to get feedback and improve our program as systems get fleshed out.

    Quality Standards
</div>
<div class="text-md mb-4">
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 italic">
        <li>The serverâ€™s API methods must achieve at least 80% code coverage during development, and at least 90% code coverage upon release.</li>
        <li>All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer on the same team (backend or frontend), and all API endpoints in the code being reviewed must have comments and unit tests before being submitted to the main build. Additionally, any complicated code, as decided by the reviewer, must be commented to explain what the code is doing.</li>
        <li>UI designs for major screens must be approved by the project sponsors before being implemented.</li>
        <li>Integration tests will be performed on a routine basis to ensure that both backend and frontend functionality work as expected. Frequent demos will be conducted, piloted by the Project Sponsor, to ensure a third-party perspective.</li>
        <li>The team will maintain software security standards via proactive security and risk management, including a no-tolerance policy for potentially insecure code.</li>
